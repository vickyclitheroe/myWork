<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm from Newry in Northern Ireland. I graduated from University Of Central lancashire in 2012 with my degree in Psychology.
   Shortly after leaving university I went on to work in administration roles in both England and Ireland.
   
In January of this year I took an interest in web development and started making mini games and websites, over the past few months
my interest has grown and I have started to take my hobby more seriously. I know I still have a lot to learn but I am open to
this challenge and hope I can develop my skills and gain a bit of experience within this industry.

If you're interested in my portfolio please contact me by email at vickyclitheroe@gmail.com.
