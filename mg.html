  <p>This is a clients site I worked on while completing an internship in Brighton.</p>
  <p>The client has a medical recruitment company which already had a site set up, she wanted a bit of a "facelift" done to the website.
  </p>
  <p>The Wordpress Universe theme was chosen as a base for the site</p>
  <p>I had to take the site from looking like <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/universe-education-responsive-wordpress-theme/full_screen_preview/7145660">this theme</a>
   to <a href="http://www.mgmedical.co.uk/">this.</a></p>

    <img id="responsive-img" src= "Images/mg-responsive2.jpg"/> 
    </div>
   
   <div id="section3">
   <p>Some tasks I completed during this were :</p>
   
   
   <ul>
      <li>
        Css-Restructuring the layout and design such as the colours and sizes
     </li>
      <li>
        Content-adding all new pages, images and content.
     </li>
       <li>
          Responsiveness- Making site responsive on other browsers and mobile.
       </li>
       <li>
         Wordpress admin-plugins,menus,widgets,contact forms etc.
         </li>
         <li>
           Some photoshop editing on images and logo.
           </li>
 </ul>
 
 <p id="final">I really enjoyed working on this Wordpress site. It was very satisfying to see the site develop and end up looking exactly like what the client had in mind.</p>
